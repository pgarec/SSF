# Model-driven models

This repository implements **self-supervised Fisher merging**. We provide an open-source probabilistic framework for model merging written in PyTorch, that successfully optimizes models in parameter space without re-visiting data. Collaboration between Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
