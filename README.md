# Beyond Parameter Averaging in Model Aggregation

In this repository, you can find the implementation of **self-supervised Fisher merging**, a new model aggregation technique (https://openreview.net/forum?id=sPtEDSVD4K) that optimizes parameters without re-visiting data. This is the result from a collaboration between Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
